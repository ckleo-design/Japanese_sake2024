This mineral-rich spring water sets the sake apart from other brews. \n\nBrewed with Akita Yeast No. 12, this Junmai sake is light with a touch of umami and balanced acidity. It is clean and crisp on the palate, culminating in a moderately short finish and a refreshing aftertaste.`,

Initially licensed by a local lord, the Narita brewery was the sole production site for two centuries. As the business thrived, expansion led to the acquisition of additional facilities, including the Kouzaki brewery in 1897.\n\nAt its peak, the company operated four production sites. However, the rice shortage during World War II forced a consolidation to a single location. Kouzaki was chosen for its size, better rice access, and abundant, high-quality water supply. This decision shaped the brewery's future, preserving its legacy through difficult times.`,

Unlike the typically dry Niigata sakes, Katafune offers a distinctive sweetness balanced with rich, sharp notes.\n\nThe brewery's name, meaning "Lake Boat," reflects its location near the Sea of Japan on a former sand dune. This provides access to soft groundwater, ideal for fermentation, which is pumped from an on-site well. The slightly soft water, with its ideal fermentation properties, is key to their brewing process.\n\nTakeda Brewery produces approximately 450 koku annually, focusing primarily on designated sakes, with an emphasis on honjozo varieties.`,

Structured and clear, it surprises the palate with a dry touch, balanced acidity, and distinct umami. It is also highly astringent, with hints of ginseng and nutmeg undertones.\n\nBodaimoto, an ancient technique predating the Kimoto method, was resurrected by a cadre of young brewers dedicated to restoring ancient sake-making practices.

Known for brands like Gozenshu and Gozenshu 9, they aim for clear-tasting sake. The brewery's current team of nine focuses on using Omachi rice, predominantly cultivated in Okayama Prefecture. \n\nThe brewery balances Omachi's depth with soft water from the Asahi River, sourced from the Kanba waterfall.
